# ideally:

- copy+paste w/ history buffer

- window tiling w/ keyboard nav
- keyboard remapping (caps-lock=>ctrl/esc, right-alt-h,j,k,l=>vimnav)
- keyboard mapping (easy configure + make actions, e.g., pay music on key combo)

- vim nav throughout whole os
  - e.g., like vimium extension on chrome, press `f` to show all things you can click on

- omnisearch

- helps diagnose + work with hardware
  - "cant read temp of cpu, here's what you can do to diagnose / fix"
  - "cpu too hot"
  - "bluetooth xyz"
  - etc

- helps diagnose + work with the fundamental utilities
  - "bad internet connection"
  - "only charging to 80% to increase battery longevity"
  - "these X apps are taking up most of your computer memory => slowing you down!"
  - "the computer is over heating => slowing you down!"

- teaches you how to use keyboard shortcuts
  - everything is accessible through basic point+click
  - everytime you _do_ do something w/ point+click, indicator shows up on bottom showing what the keybinding is for that (or is recorded into a notifications/tips drawer)
  - press `?` for help/manual/tips
    - but done really well, and customized with recommendations for their frequent use cases

# fundamentally:
- thought through from the perspective that
  - eventually bandwidth will be unlocked with brain-computer-interfaces (but right now, keyboard is highest throughput option)
    - i.e., the purpose of a good OS is to be your interface w/ technology
      - make it easy for you to express your intentions + form your thoughts about what you want to do
      - make it easy for you to accomplish your goals + do powerful things
      - prevent "life" and its details from getting in your way -> keeping you in productive "zen"
  - most important is that the os helps you get things done (e.g., its your concierge + helper + assistant)
    - abstracts all complexity away, reveals an interface down to your fundamental use-cases
    - knows how to wrangle the hardware
    - teaches you the best ways of doing things + helps you be most efficient
      - keyboard keybindings
      - recommendations for upgrades / improvements
      - proactive diagnoses of things that are going wrong (temp, memory, internet, etc)
    - helps you understand if something is going wrong + how to fix things
    - helps you do what you need
      - internet
      - code
      - create
  - needs to make it easy to extend and build upon
    - should encourage + incentivize people contributing to make it better
    - i.e.,
      - super extensible
      - and
      - tools to make it easy to extend
